*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//My answer:

// 1.Planning
// 2.Analysis of Requirements
// 3.Design
// 4.Implementation
// 5.Testing & Integration
// 6.Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This is important step, in which must clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the client." 

const Design = "This is the stage, which creates a multiply architecture design concept solution and then chooses one that follows best practices with product requirements. "

const Implementation = "This is the stage when actual development starts, Design must to performed in a detailed and organized, by programming code generation"

const TestingAndIntegration = "This is the stage where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed, and retested until it's will much software requirement specifications."

const Maintain = "This is the final stage, where a successfully tested product is released in a real business environment. Then based on a perfomance and feedbacks maintaince process like (upgrades,repairs , and fixes) can be applyed. "
